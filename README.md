# TwoFast

Two point correlation function estimator in c++ with OpenMPI parallelisation and python
management class for generating input and parameter files, and then subsequently
running the routines.

## Usage

Don't use this yet... I'm still testing it and things may not work as they are supposed to.

## Installing

Edit the Makefile in the top directory and then run `make`. This creates a library
for two point correlation function estimation. In the script folder edit the Makefile
and again run `make`. The scripts take in a parameter file of which examples exist
in the script folder.

## Running

Run the scripts from the main directory with a paramfile (examples in the paramfile folder).

Non-parallel version:

``./TWOPOINT paramfile.ini``

Parallel version:

``/path/to/mpirun -n 4 ./TWOPOINT_MPI paramfile.ini``

## What can it do?

Brute force pair distance binning for auto and cross correlation used to calculate
the two point correlation function in 3D (need to add 2D, tomographic and spherical polar).

## To do list

Brute force method:
- Three point correlation function using Szapudi-Szalay estimator.

Fast method:
- KD-Tree method for small scales.
- Pixelised method for large scales.
